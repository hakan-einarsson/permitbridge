    <h1>PermitBridge Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>PermitBridge is an authorization service built in Go. It uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, making it easy to manage user permissions in a granular and organized manner. With PermitBridge, you can define roles with different sets of permissions and assign these roles to users.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To get started with PermitBridge, you first need to define your roles and users. This can be done by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints.</p>
    <p>Here are the main routes that you can use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>/</code>: The index route</li>
      <li><code>/authorize</code>: The authorization route</li>
      <li><code>/roles</code>: The roles route (GET request only)</li>
      <li><code>/users</code>: The users route (GET request only)</li>
      <li><code>/assets</code>: The assets route (GET request only)</li>
      <li><code>/schema/roles</code>: The roles schema route (supports GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE requests)</li>
      <li><code>/schema/users</code>: The users schema route (supports GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE requests)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Role Definitions</h2>
    <p>In PermitBridge, a role is defined by a name and a set of assets. Each asset is associated with a set of permissions.</p>
    <p>Example Role Definition:</p>
    <pre><code>{
  "name": "superadmin",
  "assets": {
    "global": [
      "read",
      "write",
      "delete"
    ]
  }
}</code></pre>

    <h2>User Definitions</h2>
    <p>In PermitBridge, a user is defined by an ID and a set of roles.</p>
    <p>Example User Definition:</p>
    <pre><code>{
  "id": "123456789",
  "roles": [
    "superadmin"
  ]
}</code></pre>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>
    <p>PermitBridge is a powerful and flexible system, but there's always room for improvement. Here are a few potential enhancements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration with identity providers: While the current system allows administrators to manually assign roles to users, it could be enhanced to integrate with third-party identity providers. This would allow the system to automatically assign roles based on a user's group membership in the identity provider.</li>
      <li>Support for more complex access control models: The current system is based on an RBAC model, but it could be extended to support more complex models like ABAC or Context-Based Access Control (CBAC).</li>
      <li>Auditing and reporting capabilities: The system could be enhanced to provide more robust auditing and reporting capabilities, helping administrators track access control changes and understand how permissions are being used in the system.</li>
      <li>Performance enhancements: There are a variety of ways the system's performance could be enhanced, such as implementing caching, optimizing database queries, or moving to a faster protocol like gRPC.</li>
    </ul>
